So, I just spent 4 hours trying to port https://github.com/jlainema/termux-app to current head.

I tried to solve the conflicts first blindly from git conflict notes, and to my great surprise
I got it compiling in no time (well, less than 30 minutes anyway). However, with the current
head it no longer works, as I do not know where to stick my launch parameters :-)

I tried googling for @Override startActivity, but I just could not get to intercept the launch
process. I guess I could just just spawn a full new window from a menu item, but I would much
rather have the thing work directly integrated - well, a button to launch would be just as good.

So perhaps I will just do that, instead of trying to get someone else to do it for me...
